# A Proposed Tree-based Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approach for the Prediction of Angina Pectoris

## Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major public health concern, leading to numerous fatalities and impairments. Ischemic heart disease (IHD), accounting for 45% of all CVD-related deaths, is a prime example of these debilitating diseases. IHD primarily occurs when the heart's blood supply is hindered by narrowed or blocked arteries, often leading to angina pectoris (AP) chest pain. AP, a common symptom of IHD, significantly increases the risk of heart attacks or sudden cardiac death, making its timely diagnosis and treatment critical.

## AI-Based Prediction of Angina Pectoris
In our quest to improve the prediction of AP, particularly in women, we developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) methodology using a tree-based algorithm, the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM). EBM, which blends the interpretability of linear models with the robustness and precision of gradient boosting, was applied to a dataset of 200 female patientsâ€”100 diagnosed with AP and 100 without.

### Comparative Evaluation
We compared EBM's performance with other prevalent AI methods including Logistic Regression (LR), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM).

### Results and Insights
Our findings indicated that EBM was the most accurate and balanced method for AP prediction, boasting an accuracy of 0.925 and a Youden's index of 0.960. Additionally, we delved into both global and local explanations offered by EBM, shedding light on the impact of various features on the prediction process and the classification criteria for each patient.

### Conclusion
The study validates EBM as a potent AI tool in predicting AP in women and elucidating the associated risk factors. This advancement paves the way for clinicians to administer more personalized and evidence-based care to female patients suffering from AP.
